>Here’s an excel file of tube_nos and the associated treatments, time points etc.  The only slightly confusing thing is that occasionally a pot assigned to a treatment didn’t have sufficient seedlings etc. and we had to substitute in a backup pot—hence the possible decoupling of pot number and tube number.   All that detail being said—the microbial treatments didn’t change—so this shouldn’t change your analysis IMO.
